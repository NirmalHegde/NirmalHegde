## Hi there, my name is Nirmal!

### ðŸ˜„ About Me:
I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo and am very fond of developing all different types of programs! Currently, I am working on an application called Skribbl.AI that attempts to mimic skribbl.io, but with the added twist that you can draw with your hand, rather than your mouse.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- ``GraphQL``
- ``Socket.io``
- ``SQL``
- ``Python`` (AI Algorithms)
